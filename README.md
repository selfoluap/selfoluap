<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Paulo</h1>
<h3 align="center">Currently living in the beautiful Amsterdam!</h3>

<p>
  At the moment, I am interested in **control systems** for **quantum experiments**. 
  Therefore, I am learning to program **FPGAs** as high-frequency signal generators.
</p>

<p>
  I also work as a full-stack dev for a scale-up company in the maritime sector. 
  Here, I mainly do AWS and some frontend/backend*shenanigans to build pipelines to grab data from ships all scattered around the globe.
