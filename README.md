# Hi, I'm Paulo 👋

I'm currently interested in **control systems for quantum experiments and quantum computers**.  
To support this, I'm learning how to program **FPGAs** to act as **high-frequency signal generators**.

I also work as a **full-stack developer** at a **scale-up in the maritime sector**.  
My work mainly involves **AWS** and **frontend/backend development**, building **data pipelines** that collect and process data from ships scattered across the globe.
