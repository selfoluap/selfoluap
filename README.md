# Hi, I'm Paulo

### At the moment, I am interested in control systems for quantum experiments.
### Therefore, I am learning to program FPGAs to act as high-frequency signal generators.

### I also work as a full-stack developer for a scale-up company in the maritime sector.
### Here, I mainly focus on AWS and frontend/backend shenanigans to build data pipelines that grab data from ships scattered all around the globe.
