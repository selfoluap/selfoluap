# Hi, I'm Paulo

### Currently living in the beautiful Amsterdam!

## My Current Focus

At the moment, I am interested in control systems for quantum experiments.

Therefore, I am learning to program FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) to act as high-frequency signal generators.

## Professional Experience

I also work as a full-stack developer for a scale-up company in the maritime sector.

Here, I mainly focus on AWS and various frontend/backend shenanigans to build robust data pipelines that grab data from ships scattered all around the globe.
